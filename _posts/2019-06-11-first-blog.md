This is literally just a test post and in the near future I should be posting everything I learned here a small graphs(hopefully).

I forked this jekyll module from [BeiYuu][] and basically using this as a raw platform now, definitely would like to implement some form of new features(e.g classification for all the blogs) in the future. But for now I just wish to have a quick platform to record/whip myself to learn things everyday instead of wasting the time.
