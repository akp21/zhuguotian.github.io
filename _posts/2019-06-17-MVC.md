## from <a> tag call extends to play framework
<a> tag defines the link from one page to another page, the most important attribute is "href" which indicate the target of the link. In fact, a "href" or "name" attribute is required in <a> tag.

In my case, I have a line like this:
```html
<a href="@org.hadatac.console.controllers.deployments.routes.DeploymentBrowser.index("/", "", "", "", "")" class="btn-sm btn-primary" role="button">Back</a>
```
The link after href attribute seems a bit weird(at least for a beginner like myself), first we need to under stand this gibberish:
```html
@org.hadatac.console.controllers.deployments.routes.DeploymentBrowser.index("/", "", "", "", "")
```
Here, ```.index()``` is not a [DOM element methods][], but it is a function defined in 
the DeploymentBrowser.java class file which takes in ```(String dir, String filename, String da_uri, String plat_uri, String previous_plt_uri)``` as five variables and return a URL. So we know that the link after href can also point to a function inside the file in the backend with @ in front.

Specifically, notice the "routes" variable inside that address, if you go to local directory under deployments folder, you wouldn't find a routes file. This routes is a special feature in the play framework we use, where there is a router file translates each incoming HTTP request into an action call(a public method in a controller class). The HTTP request is seens as an event by the MVC framework, and two part of information is included:

1. The request path(e.g, /plat/platuri/lesa), including a query string.
2. The HTTP method(GET, POST, PUT...)

All those routes are defined under conf/routes file, syntax is as follow:
```
HTTP method    URI pattern                 call to an action method
GET             /hadatac/        org.hadatac.console.controllers.Portal.index()
```
The rest is just defining the shape/size/name of the button:
```html
class = "btn-sm btn-primary"
```
-sm define the size of the button and -primary define the button style(deep blue)

## MVC model review
Model-View-Controller is the main structure for play framework/web application, is was mentioned in P-shitty(CSCI 2600) at RPI but I don't remember anything from my dear comrade Prof.Kuzmin, so here is some refresh:
1. Model is a data structure that dynamically manages the data, logic and rules of the application.
2. View includes any representation of the data and multiple view for same information is possible.
3. Controller reacts to user input and pass that information into the model.
4. The reason of using MVC model is to help simultaneous developing (three parts to work on: backend work on data structure and receiving user inputs, where front end design and test the layout of the backend data structures) and code reuse.
